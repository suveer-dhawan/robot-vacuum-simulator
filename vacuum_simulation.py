Project: Robot Vacuum Simulator

This program simulates a robot vacuum navigating and cleaning a 2D environment. 
It processes instructions such as turning, moving, cleaning, and mopping, while 
handling obstructions and environmental terrain (e.g., dirt, water, soap). The 
logic accounts for multiple robots, logs activity to files, and ensures safe 
navigation around boundaries and obstacles.
